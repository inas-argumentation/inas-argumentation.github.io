Welcome to the website of the **INAS** project! 

# Interactive Argumentation Support for Invasion Biology

This project is funded as part of the [Robust Argumentation Machines](http://www.spp-ratio.de/) program by the DFG. We will develop an argumentation machine that supports users in and during the argumentation process in a scientific context. The goal is to enable users to follow ongoing argumentation in a scientific community and to develop their own arguments.

The project collaborates closely with other initiatives that work on mapping and organizing scientific knowledge, such as the [hi-knowledge](https://hi-knowledge.org/) project.

Our interdisciplinary team brings together people from Natural Language Processing, Biology, Semantic Web and Knowledge Representation. This is us:
