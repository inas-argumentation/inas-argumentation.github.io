Welcome to the website of the **INAS** project, funded as part of the "Argumentation Machines" program by the DFG.
In this project, we will develop an argumentation machine that supports users in and during the argumentation process in a scientific context. The goal is to enable users to follow ongoing argumentation in a scientific community and to develop their own arguments.

Our interdisciplinary team brings together people from Natural Language Processing, Biology, Semantic Web and Knowledge Representation.

This is a photo from the past of CLAUSE. Once, we were located at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena. We have now moved to Uni Bielefeld. We will update the photo as soon as the first group hike into Teutoburger Wald has taken place.
